Super cool demo for [React Keyboardist](https://github.com/soska/react-keyboardist)

Is a fun game but it only works with a keyboard. It's a [React-Keyboardist](https://github.com/soska/react-keyboardist) demo, after all.
But I'll add touch/click support later.

## Todo

* [ ] Add cool transitions
* [ ] Add confetti effect when winning
* [ ] Support mobile (I know. What year is this?)
